## Socio-Economic Analysis
## Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive machine learning model to classify individuals based on their income levels using demographic and employment features. Specifically, the model aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year. By identifying and analyzing the key factors that influence higher income levels, the project seeks to provide insights into the socio-economic and employment characteristics that correlate with financial success. The outcomes of this analysis can be valuable for policymakers, researchers, and individuals to understand the determinants of income disparities across different demographic and geographic contexts.
